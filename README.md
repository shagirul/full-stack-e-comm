# Full-Stack E-Commerce

Built a TypeScript-based full-stack e-commerce app with an **MVC** backend using **MongoDB** (indexing, schema design, aggregation). Integrated **Firebase** for OAuth and CDN. Applied **backend caching** to reduce API calls significantly. Used **Redux Toolkit (RTK Query)** for frontend-backend integration. Implemented **role-based login** for admin and customers, added an **admin panel** for inventory and analytics, and integrated **Stripe** for secure payment processing.
